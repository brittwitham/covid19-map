## Overview

First attempt at using React-Leaflet as practice for future applications. Stylistic changes have been made from original tutorial, as well as changing the brackets for the cases owing to the horrifyingly large second wave that occurred after it was released. ðŸŒŠ

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

```
npm test
```

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
